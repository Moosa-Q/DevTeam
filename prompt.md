Create a Python script that acts as a YouTube scraper with the following specifications:

- The user is prompted to enter a search query.
- The program uses publicly accessible methods (such as the YouTube Data API or web scraping via libraries like requests/BeautifulSoup, or third-party packages such as pytube/youtube-search-python) to search YouTube for the entered query.
- The script retrieves and prints out the top 50 relevant YouTube video URLs related to the search term.
- Output should be well-formatted, displaying the video titles alongside their URLs.
- Include proper error handling for issues such as failed requests, exceeded quota, or no search results.
- Provide instructions in the code comments for any required API keys or package installations if necessary.
- The script should be compatible with Python 3.x.
